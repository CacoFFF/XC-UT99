Navigation Editor guidelines:

Editing:

- Typing MUTATE EDITPATHS (botz mutator loaded) reloads with the Edit player (good choice as map restart as well)
- Paths are automatically added at map start.
- Do not use any Kind of AI pawn during the test session.
- In order to reload, you must restart the map.
- You can't move paths right now, just delete and reinsert.
- In order to disable the special player, just select a new character.
- Toggling the Navigation Edit mode (NavToggle) makes all navigation points visible.
- In order to test changes, you need to save (NavSave) and reload the map.
- Toggling One Way Incoming or outgoing rotates the node to where player is aiming at.
- If you want to check if a new path will be visible to another, DUCK FIRST!

Read the onscreen commands for info.

NOTES:
Code is still unoptimized and the extended navigation will not alter UT Bots behaviour yet, except for making them fail to jump or translocate.
Reachspecs don't have any path flags set, so even stupid monsters will use the new nodes.


Pathing logic for normal connections:
Water to Water > must be visible
Water to ground > Water point must be as high as possible (inside water zone), ground point on the exit (outside of water zone) as close as possible to water node.
Ground to Water > One way paths work fine here, as long as you can do a jump from point A to B
NOTES: Player-wide checks not done!!! so careful if you put 2 visible nodes without enough space to go thru the obstructions!!!

======================
== Node list:
======================
> NavBase:
Similar to pathnodes
Default distance = 950
Normal connection types.

> NavHighJump:
Picks nearest node with similar Z altitude.
Then picks nodes below as jump starts.
Works for low grav, JumpBoots and translocators.
Creates direct jump down from nearest node > low nodes to avoid passing thru the high jump in order to go down.
Default distance = 480


> NavHighTrans:
Same as NavHighJump, higher distance, translocator only.
Default distance = 700

> NavDoor:
Can see thru movers
Normal connection types.

> NavSpecialDoor:
Locked if connected NavDoor is obstructed by mover.
Unlocked otherwise.
Normal connection types.

> NavLiftCenter
Attached to elevator
Normal connection types.

> NavLiftExit
Aim at Lift Center in base position to force a special connection.
Normal connection types.

> NavLiftJumpExit
Same as NavLiftExit, use as destination.

> NavDodgeStart
Aim at where you want the botz to do a dodge jump.
Normal connection types.

> NavDodgeEnd
Dodge end destination marker, one marker per start only.
Normal connection types.

> NavAir
Connects between air nodes at marked distance.
Connects with land points at distance/10 or less.

> NavRemover (radius)
Removes level navigation points at specified radius.
