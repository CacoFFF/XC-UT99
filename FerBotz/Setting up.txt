Installation is easy, but requires the additional packages in the Botz folder.

In system/:
- BotzDefault
- FerBotz.int
- FerBotz.u
- FerBotz_cl_4.u
- (Windows) FerBotz.dll
- (Linux) FerBotz.so
- Botz (folder) (On linux, put this in the */UT/System/* folder where INIS are saved, not the main installation folder)

Open UnrealTournament.ini (if you have more than one UT.exe, open those as well)
Go to [Core.System], below Paths=../System/*.u insert this line:

Paths=../System/Botz/*.u

The game will load game definitions and map addons.

============:
The native code is currently compiled under windows and Linux.
Linux support hasn't been widely tested.

Even if you play online on ACE servers, this is safe to install.

============
SERVER SETUP:

FerBotz.u must not be sent

>>>> Optional
Go to [Engine.GameEngine] and replace:
ServerActors=IpServer.UdpServerQuery
with
ServerActors=FerBotz.Botz_UdpServerQuery


============
Adding BotZ:

"mutate addbotz"
Typing "mutate addbotz help" will display a quick guide on adding BotZ.
Typing "mutate addbotz ?" will do so, but in spanish.
If player class isn't specified, one will be randomly picked.

"mutate addbotzlist" isn't ready to be used yet, and most of the botz on that 
list load custom skins and voices you don't have.
This mode makes a BotZ immune to automatic playercount adjustment.
You may add them via index, by using Index=x instead of bot name.

"mutate botzmenu"
Displays a menu used to customize a botz, click on the checkbox once to add.

"mutate addbotzfaction"
Typing "mutate addbotzfaction help" will display a quick guide on adding botz
by faction.

=======================
Adding BotZ serverside:
Modify MinTotalPlayers in BotzDefault.ini
If you want this option to work on standalone games as well, disable bOnlyAdjustDedicated


=================
Players vs Botz!:
Counts Botz and Bots added manually as players.
Requires the main botz mutator loaded.
- bRoundRatioCeil=True makes real rounding of the total ratio instead of FLOAT>INT conversion.
Breaks team balancers, do not load this mutator with those.


=============
Order giving;
Order giving via team say is possible, if you know spanish ;-)
That includes patrolling.

If you want to try patrolling anyways:
1) Get in position and send a team message:
 (bot name) NUEVA PATRULLA
This will reset the bot's patrol stops
2) Get in a different patrol stop and send a team message (do this for every position):
 (bot name) PATRULLA

The bot will now run between the assigned patrol stops.
