==========================
LZMA in Unreal Tournament:
==========================

=====================
 Package downloading:

Clients can query redirects and UT [XC] servers for LZMA files.
Servers can send the compressed package if the LZMA (or UZ) file is on the
same directory as the package.

It is possible to enable automatic LZMA compression on a XC_Engine server.
As soon as a server loads a map, it'll automatically compress the files that
are eligible to be sent to clients.
See: "XC_GameEngine settings" in documentation.


=========================
 Compression commandlets:

You can LZMA compress files using a XC_Core commandlet:
> UCC LZMACompress ..\Maps\CTF-Coret.unr

You can LZMA decompress files using 7zip, WinRar or:
> UCC LZMADecompress ..\Maps\CTF-Coret.unr.lzma

Both commandlets support wildcards.
