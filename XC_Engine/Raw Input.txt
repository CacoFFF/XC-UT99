===================================
Raw Mouse input in Windows clients
===================================

Unreal Tournament clients can now get Windows to provide the game with
raw input messages for processing.

In order to enable this you must go to preferences and the new XC_Engine
tab and tick the Raw Input checkbox.
You must restart Unreal Tournament for these changes to go into effect.


===============
 Mouse capture:

Mouse capture has not been altered and the game still uses the old code.
What XC_Engine does is simply detect when mouse is captured and instead
override all default mouse movement messages sent by the operating system.


========================
 Additional keybindings:

When Raw Input is enabled, the game can detect the MouseX1 and MouseX2
buttons (Back/Forward) and map them to their corresponding key bindings:
- Unknown05 (0x05 - MouseX1 - Back)
- Unknown06 (0x06 - MouseX2 - Forward)

In the preferences' window's keybinder these two keys will be displayed
with their corresponding MouseX1, MouseX2 names.

Additionally, these buttons are detected whether mouse is captured or not,
which allows it's usage when the game is in windowed + menu mode.
** Note: This may cause detection even when the game window is out of focus!
