These are a few samples of XC_GameEngine settings.

- Disable the Timing Fix if you're running TickFix, SCF or a custom launcher that fixes timing.
--- We're assuming that servers that run gametypes without monsters will install all this crap.
- Use the map sorting functions if you need to fix your mapvote.
- Copy ServerPackages and ServerActors from your Engine.GameEngine block
- bFasterUpload (def=true) should be set to False if your server has a 100% working redirect.
- On slow computers, disable the collision octree: bCollisionHashHook=False

Add to ServerActors: NexgenXCGE_01.NexgenXCGE_PreLogin
